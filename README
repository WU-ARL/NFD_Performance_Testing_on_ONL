Files for running nfd performance tests on ONL.

Key scripts in each test directory:
ONL_RLI_Files  : The files in this directory need to be copied to your .onldir on 
                 the machine where you will run the ONL RLI
mkAll.sh       : Use this script to configure your test. You can control the number of
                 traffic client/server pairs, the protocol for the faces, the delay 
                 interval for ndn-traffic-client, the number of segments in the ndn 
                 names and the length of each segment. This script creates other 
                 scripts that will then be used to configure and run your test.
cleanAll.sh    : This script removes all the scripts and configuration files that 
                 were created by mkAll.sh
killAll.sh     : This script kills all the processes (nfd, nrd, ndn-traffic-client, 
                 ndn-traffic-server) that were run for your test.
runAll.sh      : This script configures and runs the test.
hosts	       : This script coincides with the ONL RLI files and defines the hosts 
                 in your topology. If you change the topology in the RLI you might 
                 need to change this file as well. This file is used to tell the 
                 mkAll.sh script which hosts are clients, servers and rtr.

ONL_RLI_Files:
    HOST2core.shw, PC2core.hw  : These are hardware description files for the pc2core 
                                 machines used in this topology. The pc2core machines 
                                 are new to ONL and are not built into the RLI yet. 
                                 When they are built into the RLI in a future version,
                                 you will no longer need these files.
    nfd_16_clients_16_servers_1_rtr : This is the topology file that will be loaded 
                                      into the RLI for your experiment.

Steps:
  0. Need to learn about ONL or get an account: https://onl.wustl.edu/
  1. Start the RLI on your laptop (or desktop machine, or...)
  2. Load the topology file:
         Go to the File menu and click on Open.
         Find the nfd_16_clients_16_servers_1_rtr file, click on it and click Open.
  3. Make a reservation
         Go to the File menu and click on Make Reservation. 
  4. Commit
         The commit operation will take a couple/few minutes.
         When it says "Commit Completed" at the bottom of the RLI, 
         move on to the next step.
  5. In a terminal window log in to ONL.
  6. Retrieve the repo into your ONL home directory:
        git clone https://github.com/WU-ARL/NFD_Performance_Testing_onl_ONL
  7. Try the Variable_Length_Names test. This test is set up to run 
     without sudo access. To run without sudo access you will need this
     file on ONL: ~/.ndn/client.conf :
         >  cat ~/.ndn/client.conf 
         unix_socket=/tmp/nfd.sock
         protocol=nrd-0.1

     This puts the nfd socket file in /tmp instead of the default /var/run/
     Running without sudo will cause a couple of errors when starting nfd.
     Something like these two:
     1398111630.734668 ERROR: [FaceManager] pcap_activate() failed, continuing
     1398111630.734820 ERROR: [FaceManager] pcap_activate() failed, continuing
     These occur when nfd tries to enable promiscuous mode on the ethernet interface
     for ethernet faces. These are ok for now, we are not currently using
     ethernet faces on ONL.

     Set up a key and certificate. On one of your hosts (NOT onlusr) you will
     need to run the following:
          # This checks to see if you already have a cert installed.
          > ndnsec-cert-dump -i /`whoami` 

          # If you already have a cert installed, skip this step and
          # go to the extraction step.
          # If you need to install one, 
          # this installs a cert into your local environment:
          > ndnsec-keygen /`whoami` | ndnsec-install-cert -

          # This extracts the cert so you can point to it in configuration 
          # files for nfd and nrd:
          > ndnsec-cert-dump -i /`whoami` >  default.ndncert

          # This sets up the file that nrd needs
          > ln -s default.ndncert trust-anchor.cert



     Then do the following on onlusr:

     > cd NFD_Performance_Testing_on_ONL/Variable_Length_Names
     > ./mkAll.sh
     Usage: ./mkAll.sh <count> <proto> <interval> <num name segments> <segment length>
     > ./mkAll.sh 16 udp4 10 4 5


     > ./runAll.sh

     This takes a couple of minutes to run and you'll see lots of 
     messages about what it is doing.
     When you see this:

        runTrafficServers.sh
        runTrafficClients.sh

      it is done and you should see traffic being displayed in the monitoring windows.


  8. When you are ready to stop the experiment:
      > ./killAll.sh

  9. If you want to clear away the created scripts and log files:
      > ./cleanAll.sh

  10. Then you can configure another script with different arguments 
      to mkAll.sh if you want.
