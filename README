Files for running performance tests on nfd.

Key scripts in each test directory:
ONL_RLI_Files  : The files in this directory need to be copied to your .onldir on the machine
                 where you will run the ONL RLI
mkAll.sh       : Use this script to configure your test. You can control the number of traffic client/server pairs, the 
                 protocol for the faces, the delay interval for ndn-traffic-client, the number of segments in the ndn names
                 and the length of each segment. This script creates other scripts that will then be used to configure and run
                 your test.
cleanAll.sh    : This script removes all the scripts and configuration files that were created by mkAll.sh
killAll.sh     : This script kills all the processes (nfd, nrd, ndn-traffic-client, ndn-traffic-server) that were run for your test.
runAll.sh      : This script configures and runs the test.
hosts	       : This script coincides with the ONL RLI files and defines the hosts in your topology. If you change the topology
                 in the RLI you might need to change this file as well. This file is used to tell the mkAll.sh script which hosts
                 are clients, servers and rtr.
